    `Rebellion`,
    `The Bane of Destiny`,
    `A mysterious keepsake from the devil knight Sparda, retrieved from his family home after Dante conspired to take his revenge against demonkind years later. Sparda trained his progeny thoroughly enough for him to retain his childhood skills with it and continued to hone his ability through years of practical engagements, eventually compensating for the otherwise disproportionate size and weight with his own supernatural strength so he could use it like a professional fencer. It has served as his go-to weapon throughout the years, and was the catalyst to awakening his latent demonic power through contact with the most vital concentrations of his own blood.`,
    `At the resetting of his entire timeline Rebellion was heavily damaged and began to drain his energy the more it was used, stifling his survival in the primordial world of the demon-controlled past. What was to be the Reign of the Dark Baron left Dante in a pure human state, right before he was impaled by his own weapon and clinically murdered - but upon coming to terms with his Reason, the blade was repaired, reformed, and reattuned to become a corporeal manifestation of his willpower - his ‘soul force’. `,
    `Rebellion’s power is no longer based in demon magic, but in the underlying force of his will, or Soul Force: a foundational yet aberrant constant found in all aspects of observable reality, from the laws of the sciences down to the never-ending conundrum of sapient thought. For that reason it is wholly indestructible, as the very thought of breaking it would imply a shattering of Dante’s will. In spite of this - or perhaps ibecause/i of this - the residual power it generates can be rather fickle and dependent on how resolute Dante is in his task. `,
    `This is also affected by the lingering magic within the blade that previously served to unlock his power: the more blood the sword tastes, the more ‘familiar’ it becomes with them, the more it goes beyond simple physical damage, the more it begins to cut away at one’s very sanity. Thus Rebellion’s strength is not in any numerical output, but its ability to change a foundation.`,
    `Only those that are full match to his Reason are able to so much as lift it - otherwise it is an impossibly heavy claymore that adjusts its weight to be beyond the threshold of any attempting to lift it, and quickly becoming hot as a star if the user is in opposition to the will of the sword.`,

const agniRudra = 
    [`Agni & Rudra`,
    `The Firestorm`,
    `Twin incubi named after the Hindu gods of the flame and the storm, possessing a long history of tempting the weak of will into adopting the power they offered to slay their enemies - demon and human alike - and slowly turning their minds and bodies into their newest vessels. Sparda defeated the brothers and bound them as a pair among many guardians within Temen-ni-gru. The centuries following their chaining have taken a toll on these previously malevolent beings, rendering them mostly benign and cordial outside of their tasks to prevent the wayward from progressing further into the tower.`, 
    `Dante encountered these guardians in his trek through the evil tower, immediately put off by them talking so much about the most inane of subjects. They became his Arms after he bested them in combat and begged him to take them, the toll on their sanity shining through at finally finding someone worthy of their power. He agreed on the ground of them never speaking again.`,
    `Angi and Rudra both take on the form of wide-bladed scimitars. The weapons consist of a curved support to which a series of backward-pointed segments are fixed, each with its own rear-sloping cutting edge that form a vicious serrated design reminiscent of a spinal cord. They are colored for their respective elements - with the exception of the cutting edges of the bare metal blade segments and golden hilts. The shriveled heads of the twins are mounted in the ends of the pommels, and the guards are simple discs.`,
    `The individual weapons, while their control over fire and wind are exceptional, are never used apart - for their cohesion in combat is what made them worthy of being a Temen-ni-gru guardian in the first place: The stormy wind feeds the flames and the wild flame generates winds for the storms to summon their namesake to destroy the enemy before them. This renders it more of a ‘pure’ elemental set than anything, but the natural destructive power this dynamic carries is more than enough to compensate.`,
    `Outside of Dante’s hands they allow new users to utilize their power without any ill effects - but if they deem them to be inadequate their old natures begin to shine through, and they slowly turn their intended hosts into the long-forgotten images of their previous forms. If they are not torn asunder by the subjugation of fire and wind first.`,

const alastor = 
    [`Alastor`,
    `The Spirit of Lightning`,
    `Known throughout the demon world as The Executioner, Alastor was a formless lightning entity unique among the denizens of the damned. No one, not even Sparda or Mundus, was able to quell its trickster nature... At least, not until he was unleashed upon the human world. It was there that it was outsmarted and sealed within its prison by the human acolyte of Sparda, and trapped upon a roving landmass that eventually became Mallet Island.`,
    `While investigating the island, Dante came across Alastor and was immediately speared to the ground when interacting with the weapon. The halfbreed’s human will proved stronger than Alastor’s, confirming within the trapped spirit’s mind that humanity was something to be respected - and as time went on, that respect turned into a will to protect. It is the only devil Dante has that has come to this conclusion, and thus bears no ill will towards him in spite of being trapped in this blade. The respect almost seems mutual, and the two actually communicate with one another even past the moment of Dante’s realization of his Reason.`,
    `The former executioner was sealed within the body of the only known wyvern in history, the mortal-born devil dragon transforming itself into a far more compact sword form. It is most comparable to Rebellion, though adopting the form of a longsword as opposed to a claymore and having a crossguard closer to the wyvern’s original form. The ‘tongue’ extends along the center of the blade in the same shape as what humans associate with a bolt of lightning; this is where the electric power manifests before extending through the rest of the weapon.`,
    `While Rebellion is a multi-purpose weapon, Alastor is much better at stabbing strikes and crushing cleaves because of the initial focusing of its power at the centerpoint. With the combination of its seal’s soul and Alastor’s original executioner soul, the weapon grants Dante not only electrical power but also control over the natural phenomenon of its title. And with the hunter’s power no longer trapped behind a demonic transformation he can manifest the spirit of lightning’s power through his very hands as well.`,
    `Rarely does Alastor act outside of Dante’s direct input. When it does, however, it administers a ‘test’ similar to the one he gave to its master. Should the hopeful user fail, their very soul is subjected to its former title of ‘executioner’, absorbed into the weapon and tortured until it ceases to function, where it remains trapped as a ‘backup generator’ of sorts.`,

const sparda = 
    [`The Sword of Sparda`,
    `The Demon-forged Edge`,
    `The sword never was quite a ‘weapon’ in origin - it was simply a part of Sparda’s body, one of two ‘armblades’ that was in fact directly a part of him, thus why it contains such power in the present day. The sword of legend came to be when it was ripped from his battered body, and eventually used as the only appropriate vessel for a seal to keep Sparda from being torn apart by his own lieutenants. The combination of his acolyte’s lifeblood and the decay of being disconnected from the source eventually transformed the organic blade into the ‘calcified’ metal weapon Force Edge.`,
    `One of the most coveted weapons in all of history, it has seen many a change of hands since it was removed from its pedestal among the Line Between: the power-hungry Arkham, the dark twin Vergil, the deluded Sanctus, the vindicated Trish and corrupted Ceres, and ultimately the legendary devil hunter himself. While it required the joining of two halves of an amulet to full manifest, its presence throughout Dante’s journey to the past, then to the beginning of time, has ‘touched’ it so thoroughly that it will remain fully powered regardless of whether the amulet is joined - which has allowed him to rip the two halves apart and enact a seal of his own upon the sword that keeps anyone but himself from using any of its accumulated power, preventing the ambitious from trying to repeat the events that led to his Reason.`,
    `The centuries of decay has left a permanent stain on the Sparda’s appearance; as opposed to the full carapace that formerly encompassed the repurposed armblade, the sword looks like a ruined corpse of its former glory. Because of its time as the Force Edge, the Sparda has a spiral grip and crossguard vaguely reminiscent of the dark knight’s horns, with the pommel adopting the visage of a skull with a flayed spike coming out the ‘top’. The chitinous ‘blade’ of the weapon has a frontward blade that curves enough to provide something of a guard, with the flat back composed of a segmented, bone-like structure. One one side of the sword is a larger, centralized gem containing a whole host of spells and summons, while the other holds two smaller green gems from which there are several indentations relating to the different configurations the weapon can adopt.`,
    `Because of the limitations of a single-edge blade Dante uses a different fighting style than the other straight swords he has, one that allows him to attack from all sides and angles thus making it perfect for both one-on-one and groups. The aforementioned green gems are representative of the two additional states the backsword can adopt: spear and scythe, doubling the physical reach of the weapon. The gems glow depending on which is being used or what spells are being invoked, the red gem in particular showing off the primary glyph that signals what spell is being used. Dante is able to use his physical demonic power through the weapon, accessing the numerous spells within the central gem to perform feats he normally wouldn’t be able to, such as firing off demonic projectiles or commanding Sparda to perform fantastic feats without much mental effort on his end. Of particular note is his ability to summon the spectral visage of a dragon the dark knight tamed, translated to the best of human ability as... ‘Puff’. With his ability to put in far more energy than even Sparda was capable of he can outright have Puff fight alongside him until he consciously removes energy from the summoning glyph.`,
    `With the seal Dante enacted on the weapon, no one is able to utilize the power the Sparda itself carries, thus making the hunter ithe/i guardian for the coveted devil weapon. That and the combination of needing demonic power to access its abilities makes it a relatively useless weapon outside of his hands.`

const lucifer = 
    [`Lucifer`,
    `The Inexhaustible Sword`,
    `Not even the demon world knows where this weapon came from: there are some that think its namesake is merely in reference to its corporeal appearance, some that think it is a manifestation of pride in the form of infinitely-spanning blades... there are some that even think it is a remnant of the fallen angel’s wing itself, corrupted without the influence of the Morningstar’s light into a truly demonic weapon. With its recent owner’s exposure to an actual fallen angel, he gives more credence to the last of those.`,
    `Dante first found this weapon in Fortuna, removing the Devil Arm from a Hell Gate that Mundus’s spawn was guarding. After the Fortuna incident he found very little use for it outside of very special circumstances due to the clear technology being too advanced to hide, but with a combination of advancing human tech masking the clear demonic nature of the weapon and the Arm itself interacting and changing with the presence of a being that can finally mold it with his own power, it has been seeing much more use - especially for impromptu demolitions and disposal; he usually carries it with him when on infestation control missions.`,
    `The ‘Wing of The First’ manifests as a metallic backpack as always, though it has slowly been adopting Dante’s true visage little by little - even down to the glow of its energy. It takes a shape similar to Rebellion’s crossguard, though more organic and chitinous in keeping with his devil bug heritage and pseudo-form. The jaw parts are extended and appear more like blades, similar to the previous segmented parts of when he first obtained Lucifer. When he activates the Devil Arm both the jaw blades and the segmented ‘ribcage’ of the pack expands outward into a form similar to an arachnid.`,
    `The ‘fangs’ summon two solidified energy blades to his hands, and the ‘legs’ can summon surrounding darts: the blades are fashioned after rapiers and are thus more suited for penetration, but are much stronger and more stable than the explosively volatile darts. He uses them in conjunction to open up an enemy’s defenses and assault their newfound weaknesses that shatter after a while and tear them apart from the inside. Whether it be on the ground or in the air, he can practically dance around his adversaries and litter the battlefield with explosions and, eventually, corpses. In a way it is a version of his brother’s ‘summoned swords’ ability, perfectly attuned to Dante’s specific style. Like the spider visage it adopts, the tips of the rapiers are slightly opened and accumulates with a highly-corrosive substance that is the veritable bane of demon hides, and the shrapnel that results from the fragmentation of the darts are composed of the same substance. The moments of agony a demon can experience are akin to the effects of cold iron on a wider scale. Dante can only guess this to be a byproduct of the still-lingering ‘angelic’ foundation of the Devil Arm persisting through all this time.`,
    `Because of the mystery surrounding Lucifer he does not let it escape his attention. He is not quite sure, considering his absolute resolve, but he always gets a feeling of the weapon trying to influence itself on the innate hubris every human has. He can only surmise that the weapon would take someone over through that Sin, even more thoroughly than an evil spirit could.`

const gilgamesh = 
    [`Gilgamesh`,
    `The Shock Steel`,
    `As told in poems of Uruk, an arrogant god-king sought to conquer Death and traveled to the netherworld to these ends. His journey saw him in possession of a nightshade that grew only at the bottom of the river of the dead, and the mere residue left behind from a mortal god caused this particular nightshade to mutate. When it was returned to its origin and took root once again, the godly power caused the nightshade to ‘rot’ into a highly-coveted material known as Nightstone. If a devil is able to resist the nightshade poisoning they are gifted with hides stronger than steel alloys - but the more they relied on their impervious skins, the stronger the Nightstone’s poison became. Every user of this hide came to meet their demise, their bodies consumed until the Nightstone transformed into a metal amalgam of its host with the power to consume flesh on touch alone.`,
    `The set of armor was used to power the Hell Gate in Mitis Forest, functioning as a recycler to feed off of the abundant plant matter surrounding it. After Dante dealt with the Gate’s guardian he took control of the now-docile armor set and tested out its capabilities on the Gate itself. Suffice it to say he was very satisfied with the results, but very quickly noted how it fed off of ieverything/i it struck; it wasn’t until he returned from the past that he actively trained with it, exerting his defying will over it so that it had no effect on him.`,
    `As a set of full armor it almost completely covers Dante’s body with the exception of his biceps, inner thighs and the front of his torso. When he’s supercharging his more powerful attacks the armor over his thighs and triceps retract into the forelimbs and reform into high-speed drills that can augment kinetic force, piercing ability and even range. As a surprisingly versatile set and his enforced control over it he actively uses its ability to destroy and absorb organic matter to keep his armor gradually charged, letting him get a sudden powerful strike on his adversaries within an instant; for this reason his skills in Jeet Kune Do are especially emphasized so he can hop from one method of fighting to another without a loss in power or utility.`,
    `Originally it had plenty enough power to leave it in a docile, non-ravenous state, so he was able to complete his mission without incident when he first acquired it. He could transform and utilize his demonic energies without it going haywire, allowing him to perform spectacular feats with a set of armor that lends itself very well to close- and mid-range combat. Now the inherent resilience of his soul keeps its hunger at bay, turning its focus exclusively on the enemy just like before; ultimately this Devil Arm does not have a concrete soul, so there is little to no resistance to him, well, resisting its gluttony.`,
    `The same cannot be said for other users, who are very much at risk of being poisoned and rotted, and absorbed into the armor if he doesn’t keep enough of a close watch on it.`
