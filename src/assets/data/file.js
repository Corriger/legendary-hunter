    // the cursed child - birth to 8
    [`the cursed child`,`Dante was born as the second of twins to a woman named Eva and the very legend himself - though no one but his parents knew of the boy’s heritage, not even Dante himself. Living in a remote manor and trained by their father as early as three years old, the twins saw very little of the outside world and were not privy to any differences between themselves and the rest of the world - including their budding supernatural gifts.`],
    [``,`Sometime before their eighth birthday, their father disappeared from the family’s life for the first and last time. Their mother chose to keep the young twins in the dark about his disappearance and went on with life as normally as possible - but it was not to be. Not long after the twins’ eighth birthday their home was attacked. As his brother was not there at the time, Dante was hidden in a closet and told by his mother to stay hidden until she came back - and if she didn’t, to run away and start a new life under a new name.`],
    [``,`She did not return.`],
    [``,`For a long time he didn’t know what happened, nor did he have a chance to recover her body... But he knew what he felt, and he carried that feeling with him for the rest of his early life. He fulfilled his mother’s last wishes, fleeing as fast and as long as his small body would allow..`],
    // tough crowd - 8 to 16/17
    [`tough crowd`,`‘Tony Redgrave’ quickly became synonymous with ‘curse’, causing problems far exceeding the paygrade of whatever staff dealt with him, the boy having abilities and anger issues that left many in awe and even more frightened. He was transferred from institution to institution on such a regular basis that the paperwork couldn’t keep up. On the plus side it meant that a curious cambion could end up in some of the most unique places - such as a rundown bar harboring some of the toughest, dirtiest, slimiest vagrants around.`],
    [``,`Tony was primed for trouble he wasn’t prepared for, had it not been for the timely intervention of the bartender. While the claim of him being her ‘little bundle of shit’ was a ploy at first, he was impressed enough by her to make the bold proposition of posing as mother and son so as to keep himself out of the ever-changing institutions. It took a while and a bit of innocent blackmailing before she agreed to be his ‘mom’ - and as it would turn out, she was pretty ‘loose’ with her associations.`],
    [``,`That kind of openness led to him being exposed to all walks of life without being told this or that was ‘bad’, and before he knew it that very same bar that almost got him into a ton of trouble became one of his favorite haunts. One of her latest flings was Tony’s favorite by far: an older war veteran who was actively interested in the kid’s well being and education. Even after the fling was over the two often met so that Tony could be taught all the academic essentials as well as how to use and maintain a variety of firearms.`],
    [``,`Years went by, and Tony had become one of the best marksman around. At the same time he noticed his mentor acting very strangely. Using all of the investigative skills he was taught, he started to tail his mentor around when he thought he was being particularly shifty; to his horror, he discovered the man partaking in a ritual summoning of a fiery monster.`],
    [``,`A monster that evoked that same feeling as nearly a decade before.`],
    [``,`So overwhelmed with anger and terror, Tony moved before he even realized it to confront the monster, screwing up the summon as a result and causing it to possess his mentor and manifest its full power. The thing escaped and went on a rampage through the town, spreading all-consuming flames that took the lives of many innocent people and turned survivors into lesser monsters that Tony had to put down on his way to killing the bigger monster. Through a combination of lots of bullets and his own supernatural strength, and most certainly not without taking on plenty of damage himself, Tony managed to bring down the monster - but the damage was already done.`],
    [``,`The place was all but leveled by the flames, and the few that survived blamed him and his mother for everything that happened. In spite of it all, even down to his ‘mother’s’ loose morals, the woman refused to abandon Tony and left town with him still in her care, looking for somewhere else to call him. But Tony himself, scared to trust anyone else after the betrayal of his mentor, eventually ran away from his guardian to parts unknown. He never saw her again.`],
    // perfect harmony - 17-18
    [`perfect harmony`,`Tony eventually found that he didn’t grow like others his age; by the time he was a young adult he had the body of an adult in his prime, and he had a feeling he had a lot more growing to do. This kind of physical maturation meant he could get easy access to places that would normally require an I.D. with very little fuss. Such ease of access eventually brought him to Bobby’s Cellar, a dive bar home to mercenaries and brokers willing to do any kind of wetwork for a quick buck. A few running rounds of drinking, blacking out, and being robbed by the patrons, and Tony quickly became a repeat customer - and sooner still, a proper mercenary with Enzo Ferino serving as his middle man.`],
    [``,`The boy had a rough time keeping his childish curiosity in check around the others, but nonetheless became one of the best guns-for-hire in the dive, albeit hard to hire if he didn’t find the gig interesting. Grue, a man that looked way too old to be into this line of work, ended up becoming something of a friend to the boy after they and several others were assigned to an escort mission. Tony was certainly more at home with the man’s children than the man himself, making messes when invited to dinner and overall acting his age around the kids - which Tony explicitly kept as a secret from the man.`],
    [``,`During this time he met one of the more important people in his life: Nell Goldstein, a revered gunsmith formerly known for her capacity of, as one customer put it, ‘juicing a squirt gun until it could take down an elephant’. What started as a simple bad first impression when he was pointed in her direction to fix his guns eventually became a deeper, if not still vitriolic, bond between a mother and their son. Far deeper than he ever felt with his guardian years ago, it was enough to convince the elderly gunsmith to dust off the old tools and make her ‘son’ the very last and best works she had ever made.`],
    [``,`A few months into his time as a mercenary, the Cellar was introduced to a well-suited but heavily-bandaged man that could match even Tony himself in combat prowess, and it wasn’t long before that man’s reputation skyrocketed - especially since he took all the harder jobs that even Ton refused to take up, simultaneously paying for everyone’s numerous drinks and earning their respect for it. Tony didn’t trust any of it, but couldn’t very well voice it around the other patrons - but he did warn Nell during one of his routine visits.`],
    [``,`Of course, due to fate having a bleak sense of humor, the two ended up being paired off very often within weeks, coinciding with Grue’s abrupt disappearance from the dive. As it turned out, his old friend was taking up much darker assassination assignments - something Tony found himself unable to condone, and ended up abandoning the man to his devices. A mistake he found himself regretting.`],
    [``,`After Enzo informed him of the real reason as to Grue taking up such bloody missions, Tony resolved to at least visit his daughter in the hospital - and found it heavily overrun by monsters, all of them carrying that ‘feeling’ from his childhood home and his time under his guardian, neither of which ended well for him. In desperation he fought through the things to get to Jessica, and found her fused to a twisted tree and serving as the conduit that allowed the monsters passage into this world. Above all else he wanted to spare Grue’s daughter of her suffering and gave her a mercy killing, before turning his growing anger onto the monsters. Monsters he soon learned were called ‘demons’.`],
    [``,`Tony returned to the dive and was immediately scorned and ridiculed by all of the patrons of the Cellar. In his troubled and weary state he simply left for Nell’s shop for rest, indulging in a rare moment of sincerity and telling the elderly woman of everything that happened. After taking a while to get his thoughts together he left the shop - and mere moments after leaving, the entire building erupted into flames. The same all-consuming flames as years before. Rushing back in a frantic bid to save someone, he found that he was too late: Nell was dying, yet still working on the custom weaponry that she promised him. As she finished her final works and perished in his arms, Tony finally told Nell his real name, discarding his false identity at the same time as his first step to vengeance.`],
    [``,`The very flames that consumed the shop responded to his new resolve, cremating Nell to keep her from being possessed before taking down the building itself and dissolving when its task was complete; the newly-rechristened Dante then went on to Bobby’s Cellar, where he found the patrons of the dive transformed into demons as well and led by the same mercenary he had a bad feeling about. Though their skills were evenly matched, Dante’s slowly manifesting power eventually won out and, channeling it through the newly-constructed Ebony and Ivory, managed to slay the bandaged mercenary and put an end to the devilish going-ons in the city.`],
    [``,`And so he found out the identity of this devilish deathdealer... It was his old mentor, having survived the burning of his last home. The fact that his own power also carried that troubling feeling that always plagued him, Dante decided to revisit his childhood home to figure out what he was. After Enzo helped him fully depart from the renamed ‘Grue’s Cellar’, the boy traveled back to his old manor for clues as to where this power of his came from. All he found was a strange, massive sword called ‘Rebellion’ stored away in a chamber he never even knew existed on the property and a note written in a language he knew he shouldn’t understand but did...`],
    [``,`So it was confirmed: he was one of those same monsters, those ‘demons’, that took so much away from him. So far from human that he felt nothing but anger towards the world - and his father in particular.`],
    [`alice in no man's land`, `With Enzo’s help and scouting, Dante established a new (unnamed) business of his own that dealt specifically in hunting demons. While the jobs that the broker got to him were enough to keep the lights on it wasn’t quite enough for some of the accessories he was interested in keeping around: stands for his trophies, musical instruments, et cetera. Eventually Enzo got back to him with a particularly profitable job, though Dante was less than interested in doing a simple ‘lost child’ case. It took some convincing from Enzo - including threats of eviction - for the hunter to actually agree to it.`],
    [``,`The first place he investigated was a mansion infested with demons. Blasting and shredding through all adversity, he found what he assumed was the ‘Alice’ person he was hired to find and a rabbit doll that he instantly recognized as a possessed entity. The moment he blew apart the doll the girl transformed into a demon. Now knowing ‘Alice’ to be a decoy he effortlessly took it apart and continued with his search, going further into the demon-infested building until he found the real deal... in the company of another demon calling itself the White Rabbit.`],
    [``,`Dante attempted to convince the girl to come with him, but she refused on the grounds that ‘Rabby’ was her friend and she would not abandon him. Seeing no other option, the young devil followed them in to try and convince the Rabbit and a Mad Hatter-looking fellow to hand the girl over. Negotiations failed almost immediately, and he went straight to demanding the girl be handed over. In response to this the two sicced a massive demon that engaged the hunter - and was almost immediately and humiliatingly put down, leading right back to square one of Dante holding them at gunpoint.`],
    [``,`At that point ‘Rabby’ revealed that it was the one that gave Dante the job in the first place, purely to bear witness to what the mythic ‘Sons of Sparda’ were capable of. Which meant the girl was completely inconsequential... a revealed fact that severely pissed the hunter off. The White Rabbit then proceeded to grant Alice’s wish - to become an traditionally beautiful grownup - and with her new body Alice tried to seduce Dante. At once he rebuffed her efforts, and just as quickly Alice gave in to her newfound demonic instinct and tore into Dante’s flesh. The surge of transformative demonic power straight into his blood caused him to snap without really realizing it, ripping out the untapped potential of his heritage and allowing him to overwhelm the demonic Alice. But only ‘overwhelm’ enough to drive the demonic influence out of the girl.`],
    [``,`He did not know how he did it, but he felt the ability to do so and immediately abandoned that strange form when Alice was safe. It carried with it that same ‘feeling’ that alerted him to evil presences, and having that inside of him was unsettling. The White Rabbit then presented another monetary proposal: his amulet for a large sum of money... suffice it to say that Dante told him to ‘piss right off’ before taking his leave, abandoning both Alice and the Rabbit.`],
    [``,`Though not without finding his brother walking right by him... or so he thought. He was not completely certain with all that had happened and his thoughts in disarray.`],
    [``,`Regardless he made a beeline straight for Enzo and gave him a severe talking-to - at the end of Ebony’s barrel - and threatened to terminate their partnership if there wasn’t some kind of background check going on so he didn’t work for another demon. Dante then took a break from any jobs to get his thoughts back in order, slaying the occasional horde of demons to vent his frustrations over his lot in life - hordes that seemed to be popping up in his neck of the woods rather frequently, though he was too incensed to care outside of them being nice targets. Soon enough - too soon in fact - he came across Enzo during a winding down at the nearby bar, the man going on about a job Dante needed to take lest his latest client do something unsavory to him. The hunter instead chooses to blow him off and make a casual demand for him to clean his office up, before going off to do the barkeep’s job instead.`],
    [``,`After the job was done he went back to the office to repair the broken chain of his amulet, and noticed that the photo of his mother was overturned and shattered. He picked up on a familiar presence as he observed the vibe of his surroundings and used a pool ball to shatter the intruder’s hiding spot; unsurprisingly, it was that Alice girl again. After scaring her off he went to take a shower to wash the day’s grime off - until his amulet’s chain broke again and he went to put it back on the table. And like any child inclined to ‘exploring’ she immediately dropped back in to steal Dante’s amulet when he least expected it, forcing him to track her down.`],
    [``,`An anonymous note led him to a derelict church, where he encountered the Mad Hatter once more. But before he could blow the demon to smithereens he fell prey to a trap that found him in a dark pit full of skulls and blood. The hunter was soon accosted by a presence far more powerful than anything he had felt up to that point, and his sword tasted demon blood so concentrated in power that it awakened his latent power again. As he engaged the thing that was there with him - a strange, blind devil in the visage of a ruined statue - he was eventually approached by the Mad Hatter again, and was told that the demon was stripped of its name and need only to reclaim one for its ‘torment’ to be ended. In spite of his power-drunk state, Dante retained enough of his mind to refuse and instead turn his guns on the Hatter once more, resolutely stating himself to be a devil hunter. But the power his blade had been feeding on was slowly beginning to transform him, even against his will...`],
    [``,`Until a familiar face did the deed instead, thus relinquishing Dante’s body of that power when the devil was named. And for the first time he felt real happiness: here was his brother, in the flesh and looking phenomenal... someone to join him in his fight against demonkind to avenge their family. So of course he approached his brother with as close to ‘open arms’ as one like him could get, willing to tell and show him everything he had been through since they were separated... to no avail. He was told, with no hesitation, that Vergil was intent on only one thing: opening the primary gateway to the demon world and letting them reign free once again.`],
    [``,`Yet another instance of demons taking away what was dear to him.`],
    [``,`At that moment, Dante’s amulet was suddenly dropped into the basin nearby. And though he fought tooth and nail for it Vergil was easily able to claim it and keep it away from his brother. The hunter pleaded with his brother to give it back - and to his surprise, he did. And while both the Hatter and Vergil departed, likely to go on with this plan of unleashing literal Hell upon the world, all Dante could do was return to his office and wait... It was clear that the hunter himself would be needed for this plan of theirs, so it was all he could really do.`],
    [`water of the womb`, `With the literal millions packed tightly into a safe, the young hunter waited for almost a year for news to turn up about his brother and his new band of ‘friends’. Said news came in the form of an ‘invitation’ from a disfigured priest-like man, presenting to him both familiarity with his identity as well as his own brother. Soon after he was accosted by scythe-wielding devils a slight step up from the fodder he had been putting down - though barely even that - and the ensuing fight within the office found it torn apart and eventually collapsed in on itself. In the back of his mind he knew he’d have to solve that, but before he could think any further on it a massive demon tower erupted from the ground and pierced well past the clouds.`],
    [``,`Seeing this as the moment he was waiting for, he got himself mentally prepared to scale the demonic tower and confront his brother. Upon defeating the gate guardian Cerberus and obtaining his first Devil Arm, he came across a girl just a bit younger than him; after trying to blow him up with a missile, she went further into the tower, with Dante following suit on his own path. Much of the attitude he carried going through the tower and fighting its guardians harkened back to his time as a mercenary; a way of coping with what he ultimately couldn’t ignore: the fact that the rising of this tower meant his brother was responsible for the deaths of hundreds and even more on property damage, the tower itself being incredibly open and with numerous kinds of demons that could just escape out into the world at large... it was too much, and he only had one lead he could focus on.`],
    [``,`After yet another encounter with that girl - who put a bullet right into his forehead before he dropped her - he made his way further up the tower until he reunited with his brother, who was waiting for him at the zenith. Unlike last time the twins went straight into it, and though Dante fared far better than he did last time he ultimately stood no chance against Vergil, taken down first with Yamato and pinned to the ground with his own sword. At that point he felt that ever-present ‘feeling’ that haunted him all his life begin to well up, overtaking him both mind and body before driving him to ignore his wounds and attack his brother once again, fully intent on round two; but before he could, the same bald man from before convinced Vergil to instead retreat with whatever plan they had. Overwhelmed with the sensation he caved in to the pressure and his visage gave way to his devil half, a roar of anguish and despair leaving him before he passed out at the zenith’s edge.`],
    [``,`When the devil woke, he noted that feeling was still there at the core of his being... but unlike the year prior he still felt like himself. Deciding to take it out for a spin, he descended the side of the tower and slaughtered several flyers with his newfound power before letting himself be consumed by the Leviathan coasting around the tower; a veritable playground for his new powers, which he used to the full extent it was worth. Slaughtering the beast from the inside, he cut his way out from its eye and where he ran into the girl again. For once they actually talked, albeit briefly, where Dante gained... absolutely nothing from the girl, not even her name. With that conversation going nowhere he just went on to the rest of the ‘forbidden lands’ in the tower, taking out the next guardian in his way and using their soul as further equipment on his journey.`],
    [``,`Again he is shot at by the ‘lady’ right after finding the bald man’s corpse, deciding to toy around with her and returning the favor of nonanswers and momentarily making her believe that he did, in fact, kill the man - her father, as she soon revealed. While at first mocking the whole thing with a passing mention of his ‘dysfunctional family’, the girl’s sudden and heartfelt outburst followed by an incongruent lack of gunfire convinced him to simply walk off and leave her be.`],
    [``,`Though his attitude didn’t particularly change, even after getting in possession of something that siphoned off of his very power, the moments of pause forced upon him was enough to make him think back on his life: his time with his illegal guardian, the time at Grue’s Cellar and with Nell, and even his first reunion with his long-lost twin... and he began to question if he really ever had a ‘family’ since his mother was murdered. Dante still had no answer to his pondering by the time he encountered his brother again, so he simply fought his twin with his new toys and juice into a full-on stalemate before the ‘lady’ came in for a three-for-all melee.`],
    [``,`Unfortunately, the bald man turned out to be alive and well in spite of his previous condition, and sacrificed the blood of all three of them to unseal the tower’s influence, stealing the amulets and ascending into the demon world. While Vergil was unconscious and fell off of the transformed platform, Dante and the lady were still active and ready to go, with the girl taking action first to ascend the tower and stop her father from making things worse. Again he was left with parting words of his misunderstanding of family... but by then he was close to figuring the whole affair out. The devil went through the transformed tower another way and eventually ended up back in the library, where he encountered the lady one last time and demanded her to stop because she couldn’t handle it - and even knowing she had no chance, she fought on anyway.`],
    [``,`After a brief little scuffle that left Dante no worse for wear, he decided to level with the lady and convey to her his lineage’s part in the entire tower fiasco. Giving her his name and a promise to stop her father for the both of them, he ascended towards the newly-opened portal to put an end to the bald man’s ambition. When he found him again he had adopted the shadowy visage of a noble-looking demon, with a power that felt... familiar. His father’s power. Though because of his corrupt soul the bald man quickly devolved into a writhing mass of darkness and limbs - but still with the power of Sparda in his possession. Though the devil struggled at first, he eventually got assistance from his brother who agreed that this man needed to be stopped - and stop the bald man they did, ending with their old victory catch.`],
    [``,`The sword and amulets then fell into a deeper chasm that lined the border between the human and demon worlds, and the twins rushed to claim both their keepsakes and the sword their father left behind. By then Dante understood what the lady was spouting on about family, and used that resolve to firmly oppose what Vergil was trying to do. After a final, mighty struggle, Dante broke their previous stalemate and finally defeated his elder twin. With his last action in the human world Vergil kept his brother from trying to save him, allowing him time to head back through the portal before it sealed once again.`],
    [``,`For the first time in perhaps his entire early life the devil cried; Lady comforted him in reminding him that he was not just a devil, claiming that even a devil could cry when losing something close to them. Those words stuck with him, even as he was fighting alongside her against the devils pouring out of the ruined entrance... And months later, after he relocated and set up shop once again, he had a name for his business:`],
    [``,`Devil May Cry.`],
    [`in the name of the father`, `Between the defeat of Vergil and Arkham leading to less demons popping out of nowhere, his relocation to Chicago and having to pay for the total decimation of his former place, Dante found himself struggling to find well-paying gigs to supplement his dwindling funds from nearly a decade ago; as it turned out, Lady was a very good demon slayer outside of world-ending threats, and and even more shrewd businesswoman. With him and Enzo cutting ties professionally and the devil hunter opting for a password-based ‘word of mouth’ system that relied on a very limited social circle, it wasn’t very long before he found himself wondering if this whole career was even worth it - yet it was the only thing he really knew and was even close to fulfilling, so he stuck with it.`],
    [``,`Nearly a decade after the incident, a woman named Trish barged into his office - motorcycle and all - and inquired about deeply personal things that screamed of trouble. Even after being stabbed through the chest with the christened Force Edge and electrocuted, he just shrugged off the damage and prepared to assassinate yet another demon that was trying to manipulated him... at least, until she got right back up and told the devil hunter that it was a test, to make sure he was ready to take on the monster that destroyed his life was planning to return to the human world: Mundus, the Prince of Darkness and the ruler of Hell.`],
    [``,`He knew everything she said was a load of shit designed to lure him to somewhere else like when he first reunited with his brother... But upon her removing her shades and revealing her face to be exactly like his mother’s, he could not find it in himself to refuse this job. Not after he lost his brother to promises of power, not after his corrupted mentor stole Nell away... If this was the ruler of Hell, then it must have been him that took his mother away. He had to know for sure, one way or another, so without question he followed Trish to the roving landmass of Mallet Island, choosing to take his father’s sword with him.`],
    [``,`The two separated upon arrival to cover more ground, with Dante entering the castle proper to perform his investigation. As he went on it became clear to him that Mundus had been at this plan of his for centuries, and the unsuspecting inhabitants of what they thought was an easy way to explore the unknown were victims of his ambition. As he continued his investigation of the infested but otherwise derelict castle interior he ran into a troublesome demon known as Phantom, continuously trapped down corridors and passageways and forced to circumnavigate him until they finally squared off atop the castle rooftops; Dante came out victorious.`],
    [``,`As he left the castle grounds to explore further, he began to think of another encounter some time before he put Phantom down for good: a knight in black armor that fought him to a standstill before just... leaving. He knew his amulet had poked out from his shirt beforehand, but couldn’t fathom why that would make the knight just toss away the advantage like that and flee. After an encounter with Griffon, another powerful devil and loyal to Mundus, he ran into the black knight once again and handily defeated him before he too fled upon his sound defeat. In spite of it the black knight felt like he was operating on some code of honor... And a sinking feeling began to set within him.`],
    [``,`Before Dante could return to the castle he and Griffon fought one last time, with the latter sustaining a mortal wound and in spite of it still trying to fight for his master’s sake. But as Dante expected of Mundus, the devil emperor instead murdered Griffon himself before simply retreating. He knew the emperor’s power was growing just from that display alone, but his sheer hatred for the monster only made him motivated to put him down before he crossed over properly into the world he called home.`],
    [``,`Unsurprisingly the castle itself was starting to turn into a hellish landscape, leading to places that shouldn’t exist and doors disappearing and blocking off access to areas he had been in before, forcing him to access some kind of ‘mirror world’ to cross between the underworld and the overworld to continue his journey. For the last time he encountered the black knight, who chose to remove his helmet to face Dante properly... So his fear was confirmed: it was his brother. Faced with no other choice between his tainted twin and stopping the one that did this to him, he had to put his all into defeating him and dealt the finishing blow upon him, causing the black knight to explode into a fiery display and leave behind his amulet. Again he lost his brother to darkness... and the fact that he still had his amulet meant he could have been reasoned with.`],
    [``,`The combination of Dante’s anguish and strengthening resolve to kill the devil emperor allowed him to join the two amulets together and unlock the true power of the Force edge; its visage changed and its power spoke to him... he recognized it and dubbed it as simply ‘Sparda’, choosing to carry the weapon through the rest of his journey and stop Mundus as his father did before him.`],
    [``,`Using the twisted influence of the very island against it, he eventually forged a Philosopher’s Stone in order to access the Underworld proper and confront Mundus - but before he could do that, he found Trish lying helpless in a suspiciously open area... but because of the compulsion her very appearance brought about in him, he tried to help her anyway before the Nightmare weapon that he kept running afoul of interrupted to try and terminate him. Right as he was about to put the mental machine down, however, he was shot in the back by Trish’s lightning. Though he knew this was an eventuality it still hurt him for it to be confirmed... but regardless of the bewitching devil’s betrayal, he prevailed and killed the Nightmare. Even after that, even after it went haywire and almost killed its fellow devil, Dante saved her from death - but not before holding her at gunpoint and warning her not to run afoul of him again.`],
    [``,`But he knew he could never do it. And evidently, so did Mundus.`],
    [``,`At last Dante stood face-to-face with Mundus’s mockery of an angelic being, he also found Trish bound to the wall behind him. Still unwilling to see Trish harmed, he was unable to do anything but take Mundus’s torturous attacks until the devil emperor decided to slay him for good - but just as his mother did so many years ago, Trish broke free of her binds to save Dante’s life at the cost of his own. This was the final straw for the devil hunter, and with the power of Sparda he engaged the devil emperor in a battle of epic proportions - and even against the monumental power of the tyrant king, Dante became the victor in their fight and cast Mundus back down into the pit he crawled out of.`],
    [``,`The devil hunter mourned over the loss of Trish, leaving behind the Sparda as well as the perfect amulet for her to carry into the afterlife as his surroundings began to collapse. Dante escaped the underworld and made to do the same of Mallet Island, but before he could he was stopped by a heavily-wounded Mundus once more and trapped in the castle’s dungeons with nowhere else to go. With the Sparda no longer in his possession and his being worn out from the battle before, Dante had every intention of making sure Mundus didn’t leave this island even at the cost of his own life - until Trish, with both the Sparda and amulet in tow, suddenly stepped in and combined the powers of all that opposed Mundus in that moment to give Dante the edge he needed to seal the devil emperor once again. The tyrant’s last words to the devil hunter was a mortal promise that he would return to rule the world - Dante merely responded that he’d have to get past his son first. With that, Trish and Dante escaped the island on a biplane as it collapsed behind him - from this point on, the story of the legendary devil hunter became known throughout all of Hell as the legacy of Sparda reborn.`],
    [``,`And Dante himself had finally avenged his mother, his brother, and everyone that had ever suffered because of the Prince of Darkness.`],
