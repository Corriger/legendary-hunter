        `A combat style that allows Dante to dance, dash, and disappear all along the battleground like a phantom of war. Counter-maneuvers are regulated effectively towards instinct, using his vast array of experience for the few moments where he isn’t prepared for something. With this style he can redirect his own momentum and velocity in direct defiance for Newton’s Law, teleport short distances to get the drop on enemies even when they’re already attacking him, and run all along vertical surfaces like he was moving along normal ground.`],

        `He has learned a special technique where he completely deprives his body of all oxygen, forcing his unconscious self to recognize what he is: a devil. His body then becomes one with his umbrakinetic ability to become a literal specter. Things like wind resistance and even spatial occupation become immaterial to his malleable shadow state, and he is able to avoid attacks that would otherwise shred him to pieces by slipping right into those spaces he couldn’t even dream of avoiding otherwise. The moment he returns to his normal physical state he lets loose an intense kinetic pressure to force away anything that’s too close to him to continue dancing circles around his adversaries all over again.`]

        `Dante’s five senses are greatly heightened, and he is able to pick up on minute differences in something as simple as the movement of the air around a person. Not only can he perceive it, but he can comb through the information his brain receives and formulate courses of action within that same moment with near-precognitive precision. He can see right through illusions and detect even the slightest differences in tone that can tip him off to whether or not they are who they say they are.`],

        `In regards to the elements of his Devil Arms, he is able to channel his power through them to summon the destructive power of their natural affinities to hit enemies where it hurts the most, eschewing the physical medium itself to utilize the raw elemental power itself to rain down the unmitigated wrath of the world’s hidden darkness.`]

const gunslinger = [
    [`Demonic Artillery, Bullet Manipulation, Inertial Defiance`,
        `Perhaps one of the only styles that shows off the flair he used to possess, Gunslinger style allows him to turn simple aiming and shooting to a high-flying circus act, throwing and flinging his weapons around like actual melee weapons and reaching far further than mere blades would; the ultimate display of the modern-day devil hunting. He was always able to strike precision targets with incredible ease - now he can just hit multiple targets at once regardless of the situation, even if he has to violate the physics of his weaponry to do it.`],
    [``,
        `Settling into this style allows him to passively siphon his demonic power through the material weapon to supercharge them and render the shots capable of doing far more damage than they should normally be able to - for instance, a .45 ACP round blowing a 20cm-diameter hole through a brick wall. The same energy he can will to ricochet and fire off portions of the charge to get in trick shots that blindside the enemy at the cost of impact power... but then again, it still carries the power of the round itself.`]

    [`Energy Absorption, Demonic Wave Emission, Force Field, Assimilation Shield, Damage Negation`,
        `A style that focuses on pure defense, allowing Dante to tank just about anything thrown his way once he calls upon his karate training. Assuming an omnidirectional blocking stance, he uses his power of Defiance with laser focus to absorb damage that comes in his direction. For every blow that comes his way he takes a portion of the damage from the incoming attack, storing it within his skin until the moment where he releases it all in a condensed demon blast originating from the epicenter of the thumb, index and middle digits at point-blank range.`],

        `He can also opt to take all of that absorbed power and exude it from his body to create a demonic force field, its visage adopting aspects of his pseudo-devil and true devil states. Ablative in nature, he can simultaneously fight and defend himself from numerous blows before the armor’s energy is spent and disperses.`]

        `The event that turned Dante from a carefree slacker to a dead-serious mercenary exposed him to many examples of space-time manipulation that he was forced to adjust to - fortunately, his previously-acquired time manipulation style made that process survivable, and in the current times he is able to utilize space-time magicks to a greater degree than ever before. Not only can he induce a state of accelerated time in his person, Dante can also generate time dilation particle fields and lace them into anything he directs them to - be it his weaponry to the very molecules in the air, he can cause a rift in the continuum to freeze his enemies’ chronological presence.`],

        `Dante has come a long way from the first time he gained this style, finally recognizing the potential in the Deathvoid’s nature and refining it into a full-on umbrakinetic ability he utilizes in just about every aspect of combat and daily life. By default it often serves as a backup fighter that follows Dante’s moves very closely after execution, phasing through the master’s very body if necessary to strike the target - with nearly the same amount of force as Dante’s actual strikes to boot. It can grow or shrink regardless of the amount of light in an area (sans the supernatural) as well as take advantage of its malleable nature to assume many different forms.`],
    [``,
        `Dante can also extend the Deathvoid to other shadows, allowing it to manifest through them like a portal to accomplish whatever task is required of it - which is, more often than not, neutralizing his opponents before they even realize it. And in areas with very little light to begin with, he could feasibly summon multiple Deathvoids. It speaks true to his birthright as a devil, more than any other aspect of him and his power.`]
